* create the models ans schemas for mongoDB in Root/modele/Schemas.ts
* this is used to valdate the data before saving it to the database


Create the Schema using Zod
--
* create the schemas in root/Schemas/somthing.ts
* this is used to valdate the data before saving it to the database
* this just like the models and schemas for mongoDB
* we can use this to validate the data before saving it to the database
* it is good for type safety and autocomplete
